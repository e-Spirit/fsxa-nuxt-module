# FSXA-Nuxt-Module

This module is integrating the [FSXA-Pattern-Library](https://github.com/e-Spirit/fsxa-pattern-library).

### About the FSXA

The FirstSpirit Experience Accelerator (FSXA) is the hybrid solution of a digital
experience platform, combining a headless approach with enterprise capabilities.
The FSXA stack consists of five repositories:

- [FSXA-PWA](https://github.com/e-Spirit/fsxa-pwa)
- [FSXA-UI](https://github.com/e-Spirit/fsxa-ui)/ Component Library
- [FSXA-Nuxt-Module](https://github.com/e-Spirit/fsxa-nuxt-module)
- [FSXA-Pattern-Library](https://github.com/e-Spirit/fsxa-pattern-library)
- [FSXA-API](https://github.com/e-Spirit/fsxa-api)

While the FSXA-API is a maintained product with a life cycle, the FSXA-PWA, FSXA-UI, FSXA-Nuxt-Module and FSXA-Pattern-Library are merely best practices examples how a project could be set up and integrate the FSXA-API.
The latter repositories can be forked to speed up the startup time of a frontend project or to understand how common use cases can be solved in headless projects.
The code itself can therefore also be used as documentation of best practices.

### Experimental features

Features marked as _experimental_ are subject to change as long as they remain in the _experimental_ state.
Breaking changes to _experimental_ features are not reflected in a major version change.

## Getting Started

### Installation

```bash
# npm
npm install fsxa-nuxt-module

# yarn
yarn add fsxa-nuxt-module
```

### Run your tests

```
npm run test
```

> **NOTE:** Currently the tests in FSXA-Nuxt-Module are not compatible to windows environments. If you want to run the tests in windows environment, we recommend to use [WSL](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/wsl/install).

### Initialize Store

In order for the FSXA module of the FSXA-Pattern-Library to be registered with the Vuex store, it is necessary that Nuxt initializes Vuex already.
So if you don't have a `store/index.(js/ts)` file yet, create it.

In addition, it is necessary that in the nuxtServerInit action of the Vuex store, the FSXA module of the FSXA pattern library is populated with the data from the SSR context.

```typescript
import {Â FSXAActions } from "fsxa-pattern-library";

nuxtServerInit(_, { store }) {
    // if you do have your nextServerInit already in place make sure to include this line
    this.dispatch(FSXAActions.hydrateClient, store.state.fsxa);
},
```

### Create your fsxa.config

There are multiple ways to configure this module.

#### nuxt.config

Provide your configuration by adding an fsxa-key to your nuxt.config.js or nuxt.config.ts.

```javascript
...
fsxa: {
    // your configuration
}
...
```

#### fsxa.config

Provide your configuration by creating an fsxa.config.ts / fsxa.config.js in your root directory.

```javascript
export default {
  // your configuration
};
```

| components.sections     | '~/components/sections' | The folder where all your section-components are located at. You can define an index-file which will directly map keys to section-components. If no index file exists the filenames will be transformed to snake_case and are matched against the key provided by FirstSpirit.   |
